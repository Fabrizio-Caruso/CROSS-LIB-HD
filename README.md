# CROSS-LIB-HD
CROSS-LIB-HD is just Cross-Lib with a higher number of tiles.
In the future a few extra features may be added but the highest priority goes to the number of tiles.
For most targets the goal is to have 128 total tiles including 37 fixed tiles (26 letters, 10 digits and 1 empty tile), i.e., 91 redefinable tiles.
