# CROSS-LIB-HD
CROSS-LIB-HD is Cross-Lib with a higher number of tiles.

**REMARK**
This is still a work process.

## CROSS-LIB-HD vs CROSS-LIB
The main difference is the number of redefinable tiles supported.

- **CROSS-LIB-HD**: at least 128 total tiles: 37 fixed tiles (26 letters, 10 digits and 1 empty tile) + 91 redefinable tiles,
- **CROSS-LIB**: only supports 64 total tiles: 37 fixed tiles + 27 redefinable tiles.




## Compatible with CROSS-LIB
Source code of games and programs written with CROSS-LIB should be compatible with CROSS-LIB-HD.

## More features?
In the future a few extra features may be added but the highest priority goes to the number of tiles.
