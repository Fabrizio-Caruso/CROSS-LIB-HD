ACE KO maybe not enough UDGs
PMD85 KO (6x8 fonts) sort of OK
EG2K KO
Z9001_KRT_GFX KO?
ONDRA KO (no UDG with JOndra and play stuck in Mame)
TRS80_GFX KO (glitches and 6x8?)

TIM011 wrong disk ?

MULTI8 KO (stuck at Z88DK boot strapping) - maybe fixed now

CORVETTE NO UDG
RADIO86 NOP UDG
----

To check:

MULTI8 should be fixed in Z88DK but needs to be checked

EINSTEIN need dos80.dsk

NABU may be hard to configure 
LM80C may need exact firmware - may work because it is similar to msx
