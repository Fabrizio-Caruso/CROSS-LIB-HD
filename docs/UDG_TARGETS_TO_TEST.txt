ACE KO maybe not enough UDGs

Z88 special init

PMD85 KO (6x8 fonts) sort of OK
TRS80_GFX KO (glitches and 6x8?)

TIM011 wrong disk ?
EG2K KO no UDGs shown - sound on -> shows the UDGs

SV800 (4K) only 23 tiles (inverted and no fonts)

EINSTEIN256 KO??

----

MULTI8 KO (stuck at Z88DK boot strapping) - maybe fixed now

----

To check:

MULTI8 should be fixed in Z88DK but needs to be checked

NABU may be hard to configure / no cp/m boot disk found
LM80C may need exact firmware - may work because it is similar to msx


GEMINI      160x75 hard to test/missing Windows emulator
ZXN         black screen when using UDGs
