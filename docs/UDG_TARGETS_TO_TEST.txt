ACE KO maybe not enough UDGs

PMD85 KO (6x8 fonts) sort of OK
TRS80_GFX KO (glitches and 6x8?)

TIM011 wrong disk ?
EG2K KO no UDGs shown - sound on -> shows the UDGs

MULTI8 KO (stuck at Z88DK boot strapping) - maybe fixed now
EINSTEIN256 KO??

GAMEBOY uses a different asset file
SV800 (4K)

Z88 special init

----

To check:

MULTI8 should be fixed in Z88DK but needs to be checked

NABU may be hard to configure 
LM80C may need exact firmware - may work because it is similar to msx
